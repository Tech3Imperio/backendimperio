Dear Felicia ma'am,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Sales Manager position at Imperio railing company. With a solid academic foundation in Marketing, leadership experience, and a strategic mindset, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your organization's growth and success.

During my ongoing MMS program at Rizvi Institute of Management Studies and Research, I have honed my analytical and problem-solving skills through projects such as creating revenue-growth strategies for brands like Hamleys and analyzing the success of Apple Inc. My academic excellence, including achieving the Outstanding Achievement Award during my undergraduate studies, reflects my dedication to continuous learning and performance.

In my role as a Business Sales Intern at Investosure Pvt. Ltd., I successfully identified potential customers, generated leads, and guided them through the sales process. This hands-on experience taught me the importance of understanding customer needs and building long-term relationships, skills that align perfectly with a Sales Manager's responsibilities.

I have also demonstrated leadership and strategic thinking through roles such as Head of the Sports Committee and Discipline Committee Member at Yews National College. Leading teams and managing events have strengthened my ability to motivate individuals, plan effectively, and deliver results under pressure.

My proficiency in CRM tools, Microsoft Excel, and PowerPoint, combined with certifications in Digital Marketing and Advanced Excel, ensures I can leverage technology to optimize sales processes. My achievements in sports and academic competitions highlight my competitive spirit and drive for excellence.

I am particularly drawn to Imperio  railings company for its innovative approach and reputation for fostering growth. I am eager to bring my skills, leadership, and strategic thinking to your team, driving sales and building strong client relationships.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your organization's success.
